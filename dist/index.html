<p>I never thought of you as a best friend… I believed the reason for that was because of your “unpredictability” and much like most things in life, I went on without giving it a second thought. Like “men” we always knew our place in each other’s lives without labels and titles. Nevertheless, in times of loss it dawns upon us the meaning of otherwise misjudged mundane things.</p>
<p>Even seeing how my family has been suffering with your loss, it’s clear you were truly the brother I never had.  I still remember as my mother said to me “Hey Lucas, our new neighbour has a son your age, you two can be friends.“, as we saw you riding a bicycle with your older brother. I think we were 4 or 5 years old then. I also remember how proudly you came to your door as I was coming back from school to show me your “ABC” ring (which meant you could now read and write),  I’m not sure I ever told you, but it blew me away! I thought it was so cool! I kept asking my mum when I would get one too, but my school never gave them.</p>
<p>Another thing that I might never have told you, is that as we both knew, my mother was very  strict not letting me outside of the house often and because of that you were the only door to the world I had as a child. I saw you as free and often daydreamed what would be to be like that. So all the innumerable times we used to hear your mum shouting from the top of her lungs “THIAAAAAGOOOOO”, (usually calling you for dinner) whilst the adults in my house would be concerned thinking “Where’s this boy?” I on the other hand was cheering for your freedom.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I ever said thank you for “organising” my first kiss with a very good looking girl called Cecilia, you came to my door and said that you needed my “help” because you wanted to kiss her friend but she would only do it, if Cecilia also kissed someone. I was so embarrassed that I can’t even remember the details, but you seemed to have the situation pretty much under control. I think we were about 11 years old then.</p>
<p>Do you remember when we were 13 and I shared with you an album of Metallica? An older guy from my school decided to show me what “real” music was really like, and obviously like everything that went on in our lives the first thing I did was share it with you. When my house was robbed, you were genuinely concerned with me and that same day, you came with your brother’s guitar to show me the first few notes of “Nothing else Matters” that he had taught you, once again I was blown away. The idea of playing an instrument had never crossed my mind until that point.</p>
<p>It worked like magic, I completely forgot about the robbery and we started to consume information about music like there was no tomorrow. We borrowed Cosme’s guitar so I could practice as well, and we improved daily. It was still early days of the internet then, so finding music scores, tabs or even general music knowledge by ourselves wasn’t the easiest of tasks. We hunted down everyone we knew or heard of, that could play and asked them to show us how to do it. We were both playing better than them shortly after…</p>
<p>But as we both knew, that was not enough… We wanted more, so you found our first music teacher at “Cidade Nova”. There our musical paths took different turns. I became obsessed with written music and the classic guitar, whilst you decided to be free and explore things your way with the electric guitar.</p>
<p>Once again, several years later you convinced me to join the gym and enter a new phase of our lives, the two “”weedy” kids, only concerned with music were becoming young adults and much like with music we obsessed over weights completely changing how we looked in about 6 months. We were 17 then...</p>
<p>The number of adventures we lived after that are each probably worth of a book in itself. The vast majority driven by girls… obviously!!! I watched and cheered for you in each of your musical projects,as you played with all sorts of people and musical genres. I’m proud to have seen you grow into an excellent guitarist with personality and presence.</p>
<p>One thing I wasn’t proud of you was, as I already mentioned, your “unpredictability” for lacking of a better word. We could never really tell if you’d show up for a commitment, or be there when we agreed. The typical “Thiago” attitude can be perhaps better illustrated by one of the many times we played “Vampire The Masquerade” and you’d announce at the first glimpse of an eventuality that you’d like to “teleport as far as possible but still close enough to peek on what was going on”.</p>
<p>At some point in 2007 I had an existential crisis and stopped going to classes at university, I stopped going to work and I didn’t want to leave the house. My family was too busy to notice anything, but yet again there you were to snap me out of it. You convinced me to join you for 6am swim lessons and play the same old school video games we used to play in our childhood, until I snapped out of it.</p>
The truth is it wasn’t really your problem, the “unpredictability”, it was mine for not understanding you, because in the moments that mattered, you were always there...
<p>Life moved on, we grew apart, busy with all the new things life threw at us, you studied IT at university and always mentioned that “I should try it as well because I had a mind for it”, you found a lot of meaning in your life in your wife, your son and God, which I fortunately had the chance to hear from a few years ago as we got closer again.</p>
<p>Like the then dazzled child by your “ABC” ring, I was impressed and proud by all your achievements and growth. You were most definitely no longer the “unpredictable” Thiago, but a serious, hard working and committed father, husband and professional. I’m proud of you my friend! And on top of that you didn’t give up on music like I did.</p>
<p>And now as I finish listening to “Metropolis pt.2: Scenes from a Memory”, one of the many gems you introduced me,  despising my powerlessness to avert your prediction. I will promise you two things. First, I will always be here for your family when they need me. Second, I will play again until I also die.</p>
<p>Goodbye my friend, my brother. You are free, you always have been, now I understand it.</p>

                                        Como se fosse ontem, eu com 12 anos de idade. Acabado de me mudar pra a rua 2 no resgate. Ao lado do meu prédio tinha uma goiabeira, uma famosa goiabeira que rendia várias histórias, de brincadeiras e também de brigas, e no primeiro dia que cheguei me deparo com uma figura magra dos dentão comendo goiaba verde e me perguntando se eu queria também, daí surgiu uma grande amizade que iria perdurar por anos, então conheci o Thiago Esquilo, a partir deste dia foram muitas aventuras, alguns stresses mas era muito difícil de vê-lo irritado, era mais fácil ele irritar as pessoas. Um amigo irmão, mas completamente medroso e desleixado, nossa quantas vezes eu tive que salvar Thiago, bastava a gente combinar se ir pra Lan house e quando chegava na hora de pagar ele me dizia que precisava completar o dinheiro dele, nossa como eu ficava puto. Até pasta de dente eu tive que dividir com o cidadão, mas era um amigão pra todos os momentos, se fosse descrever todas as nossas histórias daria um verdadeiro filme, da adolescência com as guerras de fogos contra a rua 5, aos esportes como capoeira e depois natação, aos nossos esquemas em que ele sempre queria me empurrar uma amiga feia. Mas foi um Verdadeiro Irmão. Que marcou minha vida com os dentão dele, com as resenhas ao lado do prédio dele, de nossos jogos de RPG com outros irmãos. É difícil dizer a Deus, ainda mais tão cedo, tão jovem. Sei que onde está irmão, você está alegrando, com seus sorrisos com seu violão e guitarra. Mesmo com o tempo que nos afastamos por conta dos caminhos diferentes, nossa irmandade nunca foi apagada. E nem com a sua partida isso irá mudar. Saudades irmão e um dia estaremos juntos novamente.

A vida sempre será uma saga repleta de histórias, de verdades, lendas, momentos alegres e também com capítulos tristes. E nessa saga você estava lá! Protagonista dos capítulos mais engraçados, das conversas mais divertidas! Infelizmente as noticias não foram as melhores, e a saga ganhou um capitulo triste, um desfecho inesperado! Aqui a nossa saga chegou ao fim. Guardo comigo as lembranças e a gratidão de ter te conhecido! Foram tantos bons momentos! O destino une e separa. Mas nenhuma força é grande o suficiente para fazer esquecer pessoas que por algum motivo um dia nos fizeram felizes. Que DEUS te receba com toda benção, e que ampare e conforte toda família e amigos neste momento de luto. Uma nova saga começou e quem sabe poderemos ainda compartilhar muitos capítulos! Fica com Deus!.
